# setlist-predict
Final Project for Data Analytics in Python. CBS, Fall 2018.

Change Log:
11/21 - Corey: Fixed some functions and created a master function. However setlist.fm went down and I can't test it/pull the final data. Possibly because I pinged it too many times. Will need to try again later.
